# Analog Clock Project

This project is a practice exercise for web development skills, focusing on creating an analog clock with accompanying digital clock display using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The analog clock is the highlight of the project, with two different versions available for users to switch between.

## Features

- **Analog Clock**: The main feature of the project is the analog clock, which displays the current time using hour, minute, and second hands.
  
- **Digital Clock**: A digital clock is displayed above the analog clock, providing a secondary time display for users who prefer digital format.
  
- **Two Clock Versions**: Users can switch between two different versions of the analog clock:
  - **Swiss Clock**: This version mimics an expensive handmade Swiss clock, where the second hand moves continuously, just like a mechanical watch without batteries.
  - **Chinese Clock**: This version replicates a cheaper Chinese clock, where the second hand moves discretely, ticking one second at a time, like a typical battery-operated analog watch.
  
- **Switchable Mode**: Users can easily switch between the Swiss and Chinese clock versions using a checkbox, designed to look like a switch for intuitive toggling.
  
- **Local Storage**: The user's selected clock mode is saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring that the chosen mode persists even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Usage

To use the analog clock project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. The analog clock and accompanying digital clock will be displayed.
3. Use the checkbox switch to toggle between the Swiss and Chinese clock versions.
4. The selected clock mode will be saved to local storage automatically.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the clock.
- CSS: Styling language used to design the appearance of the clock.
- JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and functionality to the clock.
